CHANGELOG
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2 (2/14/2018)

	- Now available on .NET Core!! (.NET Standard 1.3 target). Nuget package also supports .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.x targets.
	- Shipping Linux binaries (x64 only) for NVVT and FreeImage (tested on Ubuntu 17.10)
	- Default native library names are handled slightly differently now. The default name is w/o an extension, and each platform initializer will append a prefix/extension
	- Unmanaged library loading is now thread safe
	- Simplified Compressor SetData/SetMipmapData API, they also properly handle input images that are padded
	- Can set 3D image to compressor, 2D array (non-cube) are possible, but the C-API doesn't expose setting an array count yet...
	- Added some more formats to convert FreeImage surfaces to
	- Added a Surface.LoadFromRawData method to load from a 32-bit BGRA/RGBA image
	- Added queries for bitmap palettes
